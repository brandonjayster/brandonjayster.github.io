			<h4>I added the Django Admin which is a built in CMS for web projects. I gave it the ablity to create post, delete post, 
				add users etc all that good stuff. So know that this is done Im still not statisfied completly and the reason for that is I still
				have alot of learning to do. My next step is to learn how to add even more funcitionalty to it and improve security to protect against
				the dreaded sql injection. However in the past 3 days I have learned how to create jinja templates add data in Django SQL queries
				and Create the CMS in a basic manner. I will continue to keep everyone informed until then.<em> Peace.</em>

			<h5>Recently I got ahold of an old server from a company that will not be named. They are horrible and I dont 
			want to give them any publicty but the VPS(Virtual Private Server) that they provide are not suitable for any live website however 
			for a practice site it is perfect. I wiped it clean and will be installing python on it very soon and 
			plan to launch my Django project in March. <span>I touched on this early this week but only breifly.</span><br>
			The whole purpose of this project is to get experince with backend programming. The project includes my first
				CMS(Content Managment System) and its a good experince actully im learning alot and over all this will make me a 
				better programmer. Its a CMS for a blog and I do plan on letting users create profiles to comment and stuff like that
				time will tell.

  	My first project is a Django blog which should be launching in March or April of 2017. Of course this comes with a CMS and all that good stuff all made with Django. Thats cool I guess... why should you care? Well once the project goes live It will be my first fully functional backend project which means if you are needing a custom cms for a blog or small website I can then meet that demand. Of course as long as it is within my skill set.
