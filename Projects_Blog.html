			<h2>Recently I got ahold of an old server from a company that will not be named. They are horrible and I dont 
			want to give them any publicty but the VPS(virtal private server) that they provide are not suitable for any live website however 
			for a practice site it is perfect. I wiped it clean and will be installing python on it very soon and 
			plan to launch my Django project in march. <span>I touched on this early this week but only breifly.</span><br>
			The whole purpose of this project is to get experince with backend programming. The project includes my first
				CMS(Content Managment System) and its a good experince actully im learning alot and over all this will make me a 
				better programmer. Its a CMS for a blog and I do plan on letetting users create profiles to comment and stuff like that
				time will tell.

  	My first project is a Django blog which should be launching in March or April of 2017. Of course this comes with a CMS and all that good stuff all made with Django. Thats cool I guess... why should you care? Well once the project goes live It will be my first fully functional backend project which means if you are needing a custom cms for a blog or small website I can then meet that demand. Of course as long as it is within my skill set.
